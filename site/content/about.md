As an engineer I love facing new challenges, learningnew disruptive technologies, and overcoming
unexpected barriers. I am a detail-oriented and organized professional with creative mindset and strong technical abilities. I believe in equality and always try to create an inclusive environment for everyone.

Steve Jobs once said, <cite>programming teaches you how to think</cite>, and when I look back at the last 7 years of my life, from the time I wrote my first line of code, I believe in this more than ever. Programming has changed the way I analyze problems in the real world and develop algorithms to find efficient solutions for the same. The ever-changing IT industry is unpredictable, and this is what makes it interesting to be a part of this dynamic industry. Over the last century, computers have evolved in unimaginable ways. Today, there’s a computer in everyone’s hand, and my aim is to put my CS skills to use for the betterment of society and make lives easier for people.

I have been in the IT industry for the past 4 years now, and have varied experiences ranging from application development to cloud architecture and DevOps engineering.
I am currently working at Microsoft, as a Consultant helping customers on their digital transformation journey. I have been instrumental in developing DevOps IPs along the way for Azure DevOps as well as GitHub.

I am currently situated in Mumbai, India. I like to explore new places and go on hikes. The image above, is from one of the treks that I went on this year. I have a great passion for trekking and believe in being fit. I have completed 3 Himalayan high altitude treks till date, Kedarkantha, Sandakphu, and the most recent in February Brahmatal. I also likes to read in my free time and play sports like volleyball and badminton.
