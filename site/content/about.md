**DEEP MEHTA (Pronouns he/him/his)**

*`Software Engineer at Microsoft [Experience + Devices]`*

As an engineer, I love facing new challenges, learning new disruptive technologies, and overcoming unexpected barriers. I am a detail-oriented and organized professional with a creative mindset and strong technical abilities. I believe in equality and always try to create an inclusive environment for everyone.

I have been in the IT industry for the past 5 years now and have varied experiences ranging from **Web & Mobile Development** to **Developing Cloud Solutions** and **DevOps Engineering**.

I like to explore new places and go on hikes. I have completed 3 Himalayan high altitude treks till date, [Kedarkantha](https://indiahikes.com/kedarkantha-trek/), [Sandakphu](https://indiahikes.com/sandakphu-phalut/), and the most recent in February 2021 [Brahmatal](https://indiahikes.com/brahmatal-trek/).
