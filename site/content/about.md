*`Consultant at Microsoft`*

As an engineer I love facing new challenges, learning new disruptive technologies, and overcoming unexpected barriers. I am a detail-oriented and organized professional with creative mindset and strong technical abilities. I believe in equality and always try to create an inclusive environment for everyone.

I have been in the IT industry for the past 4 years now, and have varied experiences ranging from **Application development** to **Cloud architecture** and **DevOps engineering**.
I am currently working at [Microsoft](https://www.linkedin.com/company/microsoft/mycompany/), as a **Consultant** helping customers on their digital transformation journey. I have been instrumental in developing DevOps IPs along the way for Azure DevOps as well as GitHub.

I am currently situated in Mumbai, India. I like to explore new places and go on hikes. I have completed 3 Himalayan high altitude treks till date, [Kedarkantha](https://indiahikes.com/kedarkantha-trek/), [Sandakphu](https://indiahikes.com/sandakphu-phalut/), and the most recent in February 2021 [Brahmatal](https://indiahikes.com/brahmatal-trek/). I also likes to read in my free time and play volleyball and badminton.
