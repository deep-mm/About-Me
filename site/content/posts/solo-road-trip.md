Doubts, Fears, Excitement, and Enthusiasm everything packed into one bundle is how I would describe my road trip. What was I thinking?! Having the guts to travel across a country that I just moved to a year back, not knowing who or what to expect?! Yeah these are all the words I heard most often when I told someone about my plans of travelling solo across the state from East coast to the West coast. He might have done something like this before, he knows what he's doing, you might have these thoughts, but that's not true.

I had never been on a solo trip during the entire duration of my life, not even a day! Whenever I wondered of going on a vacation it was either with my family or friends. The idea of travelling solo never even crossed my mind in the past. Primarily due to the fact that I never got the courage to be alone with myself and my thoughts. It's scary to imagine not being around known people. But, now that I look back, I am proud of myself. This was a self take test for me, to do something that I never imagined would be possible for me to do.

9 Days and 11 States! That may not seem like a huge number, but 3000+ miles on road is! That's right, I travelled more than 3000+ miles via road during these 9 days. The feeling of drifting across timezones and realizing the fact that you moved back an hour is just mind blowing! Wow! Even as I am writing this, I can't digest the fact that I drove 3000+ miles all by myself. I gotta hand it to you, US has some of the world's best and safest roads to travel. Not once during my entire trip I felt I was driving down a dangerous road. Well done US, you have put in lot of efforts in planning your highways and maintaining them. I want to take this opportunity to thank all the road workers who put in their sweat to make this happen.

Day 1, I am off from Raleigh, North Carolina after the last day of my Spring Semester. My internship starts after 12 days in Seattle. Renting out an SUV and off began my journey. Travelling across West Virginia, I reached my destination for Day 1 at Barboursville a small town in West Virginia. This town had a beautiful riverside park and some amazing restaurants.

Day 2, I start moving towards Indiana with my destination Lafayette, home to Purdue university. Along the way took a pit stop at Indianapolis and visited the famous water canals. Visited the hollow park at Lafayetter for s short trek after which I roamed around the Purdue university campus.

Day 3, driving across Chicago, Illinois and appreciating the Chicago skyline, I reached by destination at Onalaska, Wisconsin. On my way visited the Wisconsin Deer Park, it was a lovely experience to pet deers just roaming around without any barriers.  In Onalaska, visited the Riverfront park, Grandad Bluff Mountain View and ended my day with home like Indian food.

Day 4, planned destination Mitchell, South Dakota. This went by pretty quickly and had a quiet rest day at the hotel. We are halfway there!

Day 5, continuing our journey to Deadwood, South Dakota. Pretty excited for this journey as I had seen a lot of amazing photos of Deadwood, and the route towards it kept up to its promise! This day was one of the best days of the trip. I visited the badlands national park along the way, it was nothing like I had seem before. The landscape was mesmerizing! Next I made a visit to Mount Rushmore, it was a dream come true to witness the manmade monument! Woww! Finally travelling across the woods I reached Deadwood, only to find out my hotel was connected with a casino. Loved it!

Day 6, moving towards Billings, Montana, I made a pit stop at the Devils Tower national monument. It felt so peaceful being there. A close friend of mine had suggested me to go to this place, and I owe him this! It was serene and beautiful. Visited the billings, riverfront in the evening. At this point of time, while I was proud to have made it this far, it felt sad that this would end in a couple of days. It was fun being on the road and I didn't want it to end.

Day 7, I had planned to move straight towards Missoula, Montana but that didn't quite happen as planned. Along the way I got the first glimpse of snow capped mountains, and one thing to know about me is that I can't resist moving towards them! And that's what happened, Yellowstone national park! I knew it was 3 hours out of my way, but I just knew I wanted this so badly. Thus, I went for it, and I don't know where to start, the park, the weather, the wildlife, the mountains and the snow everything was perfect. I didn't wanna leave! Pleaseee no. But sadly, I had to and reached Missoula in late evening.

Finally the day came, second last day. I was not ready to say goodbye, its difficult to embrace change, its always been difficult for me to adjust to change, but this road trip was a sign that maybe if I put in efforts I can embrace change on daily basis as well. Today finally I was gonna reach Washington state. I reached Wenathchee in the afternoon after enjoying amazing lakes and rivers along the way.

The last day, I enjoyed every bit of it. Washington is a beautiful state! Travelling from Wenatchee to Seattle through the snow capped mountains was an amazing feeling. Couldn't ask for a better ending. Finally reached home, thats what Seattle is to me for the next 3 months!

My emotions were running amok. I didn't know what to feel anymore. Proud that I completed the trip, sad that it had to end, tired, excited, nervous, clueless, and many more. But in such situations I remind myself of just one thing, live in the moment. Past can't be changes and its pointless to worry about the future, the best one can do is to live to the fullest in the present and that's what I would be doing.

Cheers!
