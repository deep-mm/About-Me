Today I am writing this article because after years of cursing my stuttering and feeling frustrated about it, when I looked through the optimistic lens, I realized I should be thankful to it.

Let's start from the beginning. I remember the first time I stuttered I was 7 or 8 years old. As a child I didn't realize what was it at first, but I did learn it wasn't normal. I don't know what started it, or how it started, I just knew I had to make it stop. This decision was the worst decision of my life, because I decided at that young age that it was bad and I was wrong, and all this negativity was not going to help me get rid of it, but would eventually make it worse.

Since then, the one thing I was always told by everyone around was I need to work on this or else it would be difficult for me to face the world out there. Now that I imagine the 13-14 year old me under the stress of getting out of school into college, with thousands of negative thoughts pushing me down. Only if someone had been there to show me my future self after 10 years, I would have been much less stressed.

Now at this point of life, I knew that it would be difficult to impress others by my speech, so I started putting in everything I had to make myself look good on paper, which meant getting good grades, good college and so on...

Now I want to show you how stuttering improvised me as a human being

1. Power of Listening
Since childhood, I resisted speaking to avoid embarrassing situations. Thus I ensured to grasp things the first time, to avoid having to go back and ask questions. This improvised my listening and attention power. Even today
