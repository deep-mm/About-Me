### Introduction

---

**Aim:** Develop an android app, which is basically a reminder app with an astonishing feature to remind you not only based on time but based on people around.

The Android app detects the people around, and if a person sets a reminder, say for example, John has to ask Davis for his application, so whenever Davis comes within the bluetooth range of John, a notification pops up in John's phone saying Davis is around, ask him for the application.
This app will help a lot of people in their day to day life, with real target on people working at offices.

Get real time notification reminders, once you set them, for your near and dear ones, when they are close to you and using the OnCue App.
