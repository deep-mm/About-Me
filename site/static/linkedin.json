Techniques such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) will be explored.\n• Predict stock prices: Build predictive models using embedded graph data to forecast stock closing prices for daily data.\n• Explore stock relationships: Analyze the graph data to identify and quantify relationships between different stocks and sectors. Discover patterns and dependencies that can inform investment decisions.\n• Evaluate model performance: Assess the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the prediction models. Evaluate their effectiveness in identifying attractive long-term investments.",

      "summary": "Due to the recent developments in Quantum computing, traditional methods for data encryption such as RSA are at the risk of getting obsolete. This is due to the fact that Quantum computers are capable of performing certain computations in a much faster sense than conventional computers, and by using this potential of computing power, attackers would be able to decrypt these traditional encryption algorithms.\nIn the advent of these technologies, NIST is introducing new standards for Post-Quantum era encryption. One of the approaches proving to be a promising option is lattice-based encryprtion schemes. Lattice-based cryptography has been studied actively over the last decade due to its distinctive advantages in strong security, fast implementations, and versatility applications. There are different implementations for the Lattice-based cryptography algorithms, namely Frodo, Lizard / Ring-Lizard, Kyber and NewHope. These few are the active candidates to post-quantum cryptography due to their applicabilities and efficiences.",

      "summary": "Hiring an employee who would be a right fit for the company has always been a challenge for the human resources department at almost every company on this planet. Traditional approaches included manually evaluating an employee after many rounds of interviews and based on feedback from interviewers, a decision was made as to whether a particular employee would be an ideal fit within the company or not. An ideal fit is defined as someone who understands the company’s vision, thrives in the work environment, and is a long-term employee. Attrition has been one major concern for these companies recently, as many employees nowadays tend to switch companies often which in turn leads to a loss of investments the company made in employee skill development.\n\nThis project aims to build a machine-learning model/s that can predict employee performance during the hiring process. The model will consider existing employees in the company and utilizing their performance over the last years, evaluate how a new employee with similar attributes will fit into the work environment at that company. This approach is unique in the sense that each person responds differently to various aspects of a work environment, and if we utilize the fact that an existing employee in that particular role has been performing well in that work environment, then it would be more accurate rather than just comparing skills or education. A major ethical issue that we will be addressing as part of this project is to look into attributes that may lead to bias and make decisions to remove any sort of bias during the hiring process.",
